Cooling has always been a difficulty faced in the automobile sector. 
High elevated temperatures have to be achieved and thus there is a 
requirement for high grade cooling in automobiles. In addition to that, 
other components in mechanical sector like, gas turbines, 
compressors, flywheels, etc all require an extensive cooling 
mechanism. The major contributing factor in any cooling system is 
the coolant fluid and the heat transfer surface area from which the heat
is rejected. The general challenge when concerned with fabrication of 
any component is its surface finish. Not all surfaces have a smooth 
contour. Hence, in our project, we will be performing an experimental
study on the cooling rate of a metallic component using air 
impingement cooling. Air impingement cooling is a procedure where, 
high pressure air is used as a coolant fluid over the whole surface to 
be cooled. Due to surface finish being a concern, the experiments will
be carried out on a copper plate with a rough surface. The major 
advantage however with a rough surface is the increase in effective 
heat transfer surface area. The conventional cooling methods includeAir Cooling or Oil cooling at the domestic level. To improve on this, 
we would like to explore the more advanced process called 
Impingement cooling. Impingement cooling has the distinctive 
advantage of being more effective and provides with higher heat 
transfer rates. It is a common process that is used in the cooling of gas 
turbine blades and other high temperature, high precision 
components. Jet impingement is an attractive cooling mechanism due 
to the capability of achieving high heat transfer rates. This cooling 
method has been used in a wide range of industrial applications such 
as annealing of metals, cooling of gas turbine blades, cooling in 
grinding processes and cooling of photovoltaic cells. Jet impingement 
has also become a viable candidate for high-powered electronic and 
photonics thermal management solutions and numerous jet 
impingement studies have been aimed directly at electronics 
cooling.The set up includes a copper plate which acts as the metal 
body (Rough surface), an air compressorâ€Ÿs blow off which serves as 
the Air impinger. The copper plate contains equal spaced holes which 
makes it a rough surface. This rough surface is then heated using the 
furnace. Then, the experiment is then conducted by using the Air 
compressor. At equal intervals of time, the temperature is measured. 
The experiment is repeated for natural convection too. The 
temperatures are measured using an IRgun (Infra Red gun).
